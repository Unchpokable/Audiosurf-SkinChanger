## What is it?
- Audiosurf Skin Changer - A simple program that makes it easy to swap textures in Audiosurf and share texture packs between people
- The program uses special .askin files, which store information about which textures need to be replaced and new images for those textures.
- At the moment you can only get the .askin file from another Audiosurf Skin Changer user

## Userguide
- The first thing you should do after starting the program for the first time is to check the path that is specified in the "Audiosurf Textures path" input field. Skin Changer can automatically detect Audiosurf textures folder, but, if u using illegal Audiosurf copy, this path can be invalid, cause its based on steam install path.
- Program has folder for skins in his root directory (%SkinChanger.exe directory%\Skins), but you can add additional folder which Skin Changer will scan for .askin skinpacks ("Path to skins" entry filed)
- To install downloaded .askin file, press "Add new .askin file" and select .askin that you want to install
- New skin will be added to Skins list, but after restart program it will be deleted. To save skin, select it and press "Export as .askin" button. New .askin file will be created in folder that you select as additional skins folder.
- You can pack your current Audiosurf textures into .askin file and send in to your friend. Press "Add new skin from folder" button and select "...\Audiosurf\engine\textures" folder. Programm will offer you to name new skin, if you deny this offer, skin will be automatically named as folder that you select.
- Theres no need to select exactly audiosurf textures folder. You can place textures that you think important to any folder and pack it too. 
- The program only replaces textures that contain .askin, so it's okay if your .askin doesn't contain anything but, for example, tiles.png (one of audiosurf texutures pictures)
- To install texturepack, select it in ListBox and press "install selected" button
